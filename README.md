# RC-controlled-Robot-Arm
DIY Remote-controlled 2-DOF Robot Arm with Arduino &amp; self-mechanically designed robot arm parts.

Drawing from my high school days spent assembling mini robot kits, I've identified a unique opportunity.
Recognizing the popularity of robot arms and their absence as DIY kits, I saw the potential to create something special.
The DIY RC- controlled robot arm, Iâ€™ve built, combines both commercial and educational purposes.
This project aims to cater to enthusiasts who appreciate hands-on experiences while providing a valuable educational tool for learning about robotics.
